## Daily Git Workflow (How to Update Your Code)

Use these commands whenever you want to **update** your online repository with the latest changes from your computer:

1.  **Stage all changes (New & Updated files):**
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

2.  **Save the snapshot (Commit):**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Updated files with latest changes"
    ```
    *(You can change the message in quotes to be more specific, e.g., "Fixed login bug")*

    **Example if you changed multiple files (HomeScreen, Widget, Main, Index):**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Update HomeScreen, Widget, Main and Index.html with new features"
    ```
    
    **Simple Option:**
    You can also just say:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Update all"
    ```

3.  **Upload to GitHub (Push):**
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```
    *(This command uploads ALL your committed files to the general "main" branch. It does NOT just update main.dart.)*
